# Heart Disease Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model comparison, we aim to develop a reliable classifier that can assist in early detection and medical decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. It includes a mix of patient demographic information, physiological data, and the results from various heart tests.

## Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on heart disease.
- **Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values, categorical encoding, and normalization.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate and compare several machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for this problem.
- **Model Refinement:** Tune the parameters of the best-performing models to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the final model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC curve).

## Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

## Results
Key findings, including the performance of various models and any insights gained from the data analysis and feature importance.
